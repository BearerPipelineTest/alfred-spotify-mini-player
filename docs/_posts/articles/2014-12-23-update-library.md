## Refresh Library

* Every time you update Your Music or add a track/album/playlist to a playlist, the workflow automatically updates the library and you'll get notifications:-

</figure>

Note: This can be disabled by setting `automatically_refresh_library` environment variable to `0`

* In case you have modified a playlist or added tracks to Your Music using the Spotify application directly, then you can force a Refresh Library:-

  * Use the `refresh_library` command:-

</figure>

  * Use the `Refresh your library` in Settings menu:-

	<figcaption>Refresh your Library in Settings menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

* You can activate automatic refresh of your library every x minutes (enter 0 to de-activate) in Settings menu:-

## Background download of artworks

The workflow downloads artworks in background, which means that the Create/Refresh Library is very fast.

You get a notification when background download of artworks starts:-

	<figcaption>Notification for the start of background download of artworks.</figcaption>
</figure>

* During that time, you can use the workflow and you'll see the progress at the top of main menu:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/refresh-library4.jpg">
	<figcaption>Progress bar for background download of artworks.</figcaption>
</figure>

* Until the download is complete, you can see some blank artworks, that's expected:-

## Re-Create Library from scratch

If for some reason you want to delete and re-create your entire library, you can select ```Re-Create your library from scratch``` in Settings menu:-
