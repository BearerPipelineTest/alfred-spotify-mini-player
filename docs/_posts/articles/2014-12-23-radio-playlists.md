* You can create an "artist radio" playlist for an artist in the *artist* menu:-

</figure>

It will create the playlist and automatically refresh your library.

* You can create a "song radio" playlist for an artist in the *Current Track* menu:-

</figure>

* Also, as explained in [Customization]( {{ site.url }}/articles/customization), you can decide to not add the radio playlist to your library, by modifying variable `add_created_radio_playlist_to_library`:-
