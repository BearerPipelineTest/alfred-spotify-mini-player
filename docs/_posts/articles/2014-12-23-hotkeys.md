Spotify Mini Player has full support of [Alfred hotkeys](http://support.alfredapp.com/workflows:config:triggers-hotkey) to invoke the workflow and for every possible action !

## Invoke workflows with hotkeys

It is highly recommended to use hotkeys to invoke the workflow rather than the keyword `spot_mini`

To setup hotkeys, see example below(click to see in fullscreen):-

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/setup_hotkeys1.gif"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/setup_hotkeys1.gif"></a>
	<figcaption>Setup hotkeys.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can setup hotkeys to:-

* Show main window

* Show Current track menu

* Show Alfred Playlist menu

* Show Playlists menu

* Show Charts menu

* Show Settings menu

* Show New Releases menu



## Invoke actions with hotkeys

For every possible action with Spotify Mini Player, you can configure hotkey.
Simply add hotkeys for actions you want:-
